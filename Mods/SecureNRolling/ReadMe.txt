NOTE:  BEFORE INSTALLING -->ANY<--  MOD, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVED GAMES!!!

Installs just like almost every mod. Does not require a new game.

This mod should work server side just fine!

After extracting the downloaded zip file contents just place the entire folder
"SecureNRolling" into your mods folder and you should be ready to go.

The old Mods folder was located here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods 

The newer Mods folder (recommended) is located here:
C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods

You can also put   %AppData%\7DaysToDie\Mods  in the address bar in Windows Explorer
or in the Search Box on your desktop and it will take you to the correct location.


This mod allows you to craft a 2 Door Variant Helper to allow you to make
most of the existing Doors. You can destroy an existing door and 
it will appear in your inventory as a Doors Variant Helper. You can then 
choose which door or you would like it to install with the radial menu! 

A recipe is included for the Door Variant Helper based on what I would
think would be SecureNRolling.



I hope you enjoy the mod!
